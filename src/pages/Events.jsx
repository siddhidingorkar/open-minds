          content="Open Minds gaps in education systems with innovative, low-cost and replicable interventions. Working both directly and through government systems, these programs reach millions of children and school dropouts each year. In direct work, an instructor works with children either in the school or in the community, whereas the partnership model involves teams working closely with government teams at the state, district or city level to implement programs. Its approach to improving learning outcomes continues to serve as a model, both within India and beyond.
        
        Our efforts for the last two decades have been largely focussed on finding a solution for this learning crisis."

          content="From 2012 we have been working directly on helping children in Grade 3 and above, catch up on basic reading and arithmetic. This teaching-learning approach is called Teaching at the Right Level (TaRL). Targeted at children enrolled in government schools in Grades 3 to 5, these intensive bursts of activity ensured that by the end of the last camp more than 70% of children were able to read simple texts fluently and confidently do arithmetic operations."

          title="Open Minds' Early Childhood Education"
          content="Our program focuses on the holistic development of children and their readiness for school in the age group of 3-8 years. This is done with the support of  mothers, school teachers and volunteers in the community. 
        
        The instructor has a strong understanding of the local context, which helps effectively interact with children and engage with parents. The content is based on the child’s immediate surroundings. Activities are conducted in groups and individually and are supported with contextualized play material such as cards, beads, clay and objects. Children are regularly assessed by instructors through simple activities. Mothers are also engaged through periodic meetings, discussions, creation of mothers’ groups in the community and individual home visits."

          title="Open Minds' Elementary Education"
          content="Our initiatives span the entire age range from Grade I to Grade VIII. However, much of the work in the last two decades has been with children of primary school age. Our education interventions have two major components – the actual teaching-learning approach and the implementation models.

        Our teaching-learning approach is called CAMaL which stands for Combined Activities for Maximized Learning. Learning goals are clearly articulated so that teachers know what is to be achieved. Simple assessment is used for grouping children for instruction. Appropriate but low-cost teaching-learning materials are developed for the program."

          title="Open Minds’ Digital Initiatives"
          content="The Hybrid learning program involves getting children in the age group 10-14 in a village to form their own groups of 5-6 each, thus enabling them to co-create a learning space within their community. Digital devices and content placed directly in the hands of children providing them with opportunities and choices to learn on their own. Groups engage in choice-based learning and are guided by the coaches and youth members in the communities.

        The program aims to create an open learning mechanism enabling children and youth to prepare for school, work, and life. It has been designed on the premise that children can be motivated to learn on their own. Children learn on tablets and do projects or conduct activities and then present what they have learned in front of a live audience of parents."
